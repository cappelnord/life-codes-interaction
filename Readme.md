This [Godot 4.2](https://godotengine.org/) project is the graphical user interface for Alexandra CÃ¡rdenas' installation Life Codes, produced by EPFL Pavilions for the installation *Musica ex Machina*.

## Further documentation pending ...

... meanwhile - if you are courageous - you can open this project with Godot and try to make sense of it by also studying the [Life Codes Runtime](https://github.com/cappelnord/life-codes-runtime).
